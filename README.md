# Free trade simulator

## I want to play a game
Let's play a very simple game. At the beginning, we have 100 people, each with 100 tokens. Each
round each person gives one of his tokens to another person that is randomly chosen (could be
himself, for simplicity's sake). After each round, it is possible that some people end up with no
token, and these people are "broke", and they are no longer part of this game. Give it
enough rounds (17000 rounds, in this program), what happens?

This program shows a distribution of tokens as rounds go, sorted by descending number of tokens,
with broke people removed.

## With buff
Let's imagine some people come with "buffs", meaning his chance of getting someone's token is 1%
larger than the purely random chance.

People with buffs are shown in red, as opposed to the default blue.

## Conclusion
There are inequalities everywhere in society. Inequality in itself is not a bad thing, but it's
interesting to know something about it.

As the program demonstrates, even in a purely fair simulation, meaning nobody has buffs, many people
go broke, and the wealthiest has far more tokens than they initially had.

With buffs there is no guarantee that one does not go broke, but the chance that the person with
buff ends up "ahead" is much larger. Meaning, even if you have a small advantage over others, be it
starting capital, networking and/or efforts, you'll most likely end up far better than the average.
1% advantage translates into far more than 1% more reward. So working hard does pay well!
